# Traffic Management Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing traffic management through the application of computer vision and deep learning techniques. We developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for two main tasks: traffic sign classification and distracted driver detection.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Sign Classification**: 
  - Classified traffic signs into 43 categories.
  - Achieved high performance with:
    - **Precision**: 0.9802
    - **Recall**: 0.9769
    - **Accuracy**: 0.9990

- **Distracted Driver Detection**: 
  - Identified 10 different driver behaviors.
  - Achieved excellent results with:
    - **Precision**: 0.9942
    - **Recall**: 0.9942
    - **Accuracy**: 0.9988

## Datasets

- **Traffic Sign Dataset**: Contains images of traffic signs categorized into 43 different types.
- **Distracted Driver Dataset**: Comprises images of drivers exhibiting 10 distinct behaviors.

## Models and Methodology

### Traffic Sign Classification

- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Categories**: 43 types of traffic signs


### Distracted Driver Detection
