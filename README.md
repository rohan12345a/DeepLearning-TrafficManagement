Our project focuses on enhancing road safety through advanced deep learning techniques. We've developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models capable of accurately classifying traffic signs across 43 different categories and detecting distracted drivers, classifying them into 10 distinct categories based on their behavior.

## Models

- **Traffic Sign Classifier**: Our CNN model accurately classifies traffic signs into 43 different categories. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset and evaluated extensively to ensure its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

- **Distracted Driver Detection**: We've trained a separate model for detecting distracted drivers, categorizing them into 10 distinct behaviors. This model contributes to improving overall road safety by identifying potentially hazardous driving behaviors.

## Optimization

To optimize performance, we implemented Bayesian optimization techniques to fine-tune the hyperparameters of specific models. This ensures that our models operate at peak efficiency, further enhancing their accuracy and reliability.
